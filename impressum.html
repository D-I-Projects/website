        This "Impressum," as defined in Germany, is not fully filled out because we believe we do not fall under the legal requirements specified by law.
        This website is dedicated solely to providing information about our open-source projects hosted on platforms like GitHub. It does not engage in commercial activities, offer products or services for sale, or contain journalistic content.
        According to our understanding of German law, websites that do not pursue commercial objectives, do not offer goods or services for sale, and do not contain journalistic or editorial content generally do not require an Impressum.
